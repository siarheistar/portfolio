Purpose of this CA is to plan, design, develop and deploy a web application using Django framework and AWS services like Cloud9, S3 storage, My SQL instance and ELB. The project idea is to design personal profile web application displaying a home page with general profile owner information, shortcuts with pictures to completed jobs, links to blog posts (list of blog posts and detailed blog posts), link to a LinkedIn profile, a page displaying Trade simulation run results retrieved from MySQL RDS instance. All blog and job posts are performed from the Django Admin page. Authenticated users are added in Admin page. Web application design is performed using a Bootstrap template.
I.	INTRODUCTION
The main idea for this project composition is derived from professional experience and necessity to maintain personal profile giving opportunity to introduce personal and professional personâ€™s overview.
For this purpose, best fit is to design and develop a web application demonstrating knowledge, proof of completed projects (jobs), blog posts, and displaying results from trades simulation run based on other project run results as a cross reference.
To bring this idea to life was decided to develop such application using such Django framework based on AWS services like Cloud9, S3 bucket storage, MySQL RDS instance.
All picture images are being stored in S3 Static and Media locations. User can add, modify and delete records from a database.
